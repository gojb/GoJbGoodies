/**
 * A multithreaded chat room server.  When a client connects the
 * server requests a screen name by sending the client the
 * text "SUBMITNAME", and keeps requesting a name until
 * a unique one is received.  After a client submits a unique
 * name, the server acknowledges with "NAMEACCEPTED".  Then
 * all messages from that client will be broadcast to all other
 * clients that have submitted a unique screen name.  The
 * broadcast messages are prefixed with "MESSAGE ".
 *
 * Because this is just a teaching example to illustrate a simple
 * chat server, there are a few features that have been left out.
 * Two are very useful and belong in production code:
 *
 *     1. The protocol should be enhanced so that the client can
 *        send clean disconnect messages to the server.
 *
 *     2. The server should do some logging.

/**
 * A server for a network multi-player tic tac toe game.  Modified and
 * extended from the class presented in Deitel and Deitel "Java How to
 * Program" book.  I made a bunch of enhancements and rewrote large sections
 * of the code.  The main change is instead of passing *data* between the
 * client and server, I made a TTTP (tic tac toe protocol) which is totally
 * plain text, so you can test the game with Telnet (always a good idea.)
 * The strings that are sent in TTTP are:
 *
 *  Client -> Server           Server -> Client
 *  ----------------           ----------------
 *  MOVE <n>  (0 <= n <= 8)    WELCOME <char>  (char in {X, O})
 *  QUIT                       VALID_MOVE
 *                             OTHER_PLAYER_MOVED <n>
 *                             VICTORY
 *                             DEFEAT
 *                             TIE
 *                             MESSAGE <text>
 *
 * A second change is that it allows an unlimited number of pairs of
 * players to play.
